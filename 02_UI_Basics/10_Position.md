Note that the Horizon header makes use of `position: absolute` to place the seagulls over the `h1` text.



# Position
- [ ] Understanding positioning ([w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp), [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position))
   * `static` (Default: keeps its position in the [Flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flow_Layout))
   * `relative` (Can be positioned _relative_ to its natural position in the Flow. Retains its place in the Flow, leaving a gap.)
   * `absolute` (Taken out of the Flow, to be positioned with respect to the nearest parent whose `position` is not `static`. Its place in the Flow is closed up.)
   * `fixed` (As with `absolute`, but positioned with respect to the viewport.)
   * `sticky` (Keeps its place in the flow like `static`, until it reaches a "barrier", and then it behaves like `fixed`, except that the gap it occupied never closes, and that it cannot move outside it scrollable ancestor.)
- [ ] Position offsets
   * `top` ([w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_top.asp), [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/top))
   * `bottom` ([w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_bottom.asp), [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/bottom))
   * `right` ([w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_right.asp), [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/right))
   * `left` ([w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_left.asp), [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/left))
- [ ] Layering boxes with z-index ([w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_z-index.asp), [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index))
